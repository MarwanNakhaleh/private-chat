# Introduction
Like-minded people are able to connect more easily than ever before, and in a manner far more globally reaching than ever before. Having said that, the evolution of Web2 has inadvertently created an oligopoly on communication, where almost no matter how you communicate digitally, the media through which you send this communication reserve the right to delete or silence your ideas. 

While we do have private communication apps like [Signal](https://signal.org/download/), Signal and its peers are insufficient to manage a whole culture. We also have internet subcultures stemming (almost) entirely from imageboards such as [4chan](https://4chan.org), but everything posted on 4chan is public and government entities and subversive agents like to try and tie identities to anonymous posts and muck around with attempting to change the culture. 

I believe that for a decentralized active internet culture to emerge, we need a combination of the two built with the privacy of Signal but with the functionality of 4chan. This project is attempting to create that. I have no intention of storing people's message in a central server, and I want to add features that facilitate creation and spread of cultural ideas (or memes). 

I'm kinda sorta playing with the idea of storing encrypted messages on a blockchain for future retrieval and for people to connect with a blockchain wallet. But as we say in Web3, first build a centralized PoC of your application, then decentralize it.
